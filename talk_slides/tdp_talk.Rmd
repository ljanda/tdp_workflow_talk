## Workflow {.build} 

What is workflow?

- Your personal way of taking data and turning it into product
- Eg your software, home directory name, and your unpolished work

What is product?

- Your raw data
- All code that is run to clean and use your raw data 


## Why care about your workflow? 

- Collaboration
- Self-care 
- Reproducibility
- Environment switching



## How? 

- Clear file structure 
- Software that allows for all your needs 
(in my case R and RStudio with R Projects, R Markdown, and a connection to 
a redshift DB)



## File structure {.build}

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/file_structure.png'))
```

-  To maximize reproducibility 
projects files should be git repositories and 
structured in a logical, consistent manner
- Use RStudio git GUI or in the Terminal tab in RStudio

## File Structure {.build}

File creation shortcut
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)

folder_names <- c("src", "input_data", "output_data")  # set folder names
sapply(folder_names, dir.create)  # generate folders in current directory
```

Example project folder
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='55%', fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/file_layout.png'))
```



## Use R projects {.build}

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='35%', fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/rproj.png'))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='55%', fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/lotsarproj.png'))
```

- Run multiple projects! 
- Keep all your work contained together in one area
- Share work and collaborate easily 


## Use here::here() {.build}

- DO NOT USE setwd()
- It won't work for others and it probably 
won't work for you in a year either 
- Instead, use the here package 

```{r}
library(here)

here()
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ul <- read_csv(here::here("data/input/unit_lookup_table.csv"))
```


## Never save workspace {.build}

- All R scripts should be written with the ability to run from a fresh R instance on any computer 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/dontsave.png'))
```


## Other tips

- Leave your .Rprofile alone! 
- Restart R often, re-run code in a fresh setting 
- This does not mean that your code has to look beautiful and perfect! 
Just that it can run without being dependent on anything that you set locally
- But, do follow a code style guide so that it is easy to read

## Database Connection

- If you can connect directly to a DB, do it! 
- Then your source code is the important material, 
not the CSV sitting somewhere
- If the query is large, can always write it to 
a file like .csv, .Rda, .feather, etc
then read that in for any report 


## DB Connection {.build}

- Can use SQL 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t1 <- tbl(con, sql(
  "SELECT 
	dim_user.user_business_key AS user_business_key,
  dim_user.school_name AS school_name,
  TO_CHAR(fact_curriculum_event.request_time, 
    'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.MS') AS timestamp_date_time,
	fact_curriculum_event.body_object_id AS event_name
  FROM events.events_curriculum AS fact_event
  LEFT JOIN users.dim_user AS dim_user
  ON fact_curriculum_event.body_actor_account_name =
      dim_user_v2.user_business_key 
  WHERE (dim_user.district_name = 'District1')"))
```


## DB Connection {.build}

- Can also use dplyr code with the dbplyr package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t2 <- 
  t1 %>% 
  filter(school_name == "School One") %>% 
  collect()

BRRR::skrrrahh(sound = 26)

path <- here::here("data/raw_events.feather")
write_feather(t1, path)
```



## DB Connection {.build}

- Can wrap connection in a function and call the function or make a package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
amp_connect <- function(key_name = "datawarehouse") {
 DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
            Driver   = "driver/path/libamazonredshiftodbc.dylib",
            Server   = "localhost",
            Port     = 5439,
            Database = "dev",
            UID      = keyring::key_list("datawarehouse")[1,2],
            PWD      = keyring::key_get("datawarehouse"),
            bigint   = "integer")
}
```


## Reports {.build}

- Making reports like RMarkdown look nice, are easy to share
- Can be knit to doc and shared as a google doc for collaborative
editing with coworkers that don't code
- Can be knit to html and hosted to share easily when editing is not needed
- Use kable and kableExtra, tabset, html, and css to make them extra nice


## Parameterized YAML headers {.build}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/yaml_header.png'))
```

- <a href='https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#yaml-header' title=''>Parameterized Yaml Headers</a>

## Summary {.build}

- Source is product
- Don't do anything locally, do it all in your code!
- Use rprojects, here(), DB connection, git, rmarkdown

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%', fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/ttp_dunk.jpg'))
```
